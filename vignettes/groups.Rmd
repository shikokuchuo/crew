Each controller object only supports only one type of worker configuration which you set in advance. However, different controllers may have different types of workers, and `crew` supports controller groups to coordinate among these different worker types. With third-party launcher plugins from other packages, this mechanism will allow you to e.g. send some tasks to GPU-capable or high-memory workers while other tasks go to low-spec workers.

We demonstrate with a controller of fully persistent workers which always stay running and a controller of semi-persistent workers which terminate after completing four tasks. We create controller objects with names.

```r
library(crew)
persistent <- crew_controller_local(name = "persistent")
transient <- crew_controller_local(name = "semi-persistent", tasks_max = 4L)
```

`crew` uses a different TCP port for each controller you run, so please do not create hundreds of controllers. Please see the subsection on ports in the [README](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/index.html).

We put these controller objects into a new controller group object.

```r
group <- crew_controller_group(persistent, transient)
```

This controller group has a global `connect()` method to initialize both controllers.

```r
group$start()
```

You can choose which worker pool to receive tasks.

```r
group$push(name = "my task", command = sqrt(4), controller = "semi-persistent")
```

The controller group also supports global methods for `wait()`, `pop()`, and `terminate()`. These methods operate on all controllers at once by default, but the `controllers` argument allows you to select a subset of controllers to act on. Below in `pop()` the `controller` column of the output indicates which controller ran the task.

```r
group$wait(controllers = "semi-persistent")
group$pop()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 13
#>   name    command result    status error  code trace warnings seconds  seed
#>   <chr>   <chr>   <list>    <chr>  <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>      <dbl> <int>
#> 1 my task sqrt(4) <dbl [1]> succe… NA        0 NA    NA             0    NA
#> # ℹ 3 more variables: algorithm <chr>, controller <chr>, worker <chr>
```

The [`map()`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/reference/crew_class_controller.html#method-crew_class_controller-group-map) method provides functional programming, and the `controller` argument lets you choose the controller to submit the tasks.

```r
group$map(
  command = a + b + c + d,
  iterate = list(
    a = c(1, 3),
    b = c(2, 4)
  ),
  data = list(c = 5),
  globals = list(d = 6),
  controller = "persistent"
)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 13
#>   name       command result status error  code trace warnings seconds  seed
#>   <chr>      <chr>   <list> <chr>  <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>      <dbl> <int>
#> 1 unnamed_t… a + b … <dbl>  succe… NA        0 NA    NA             0    NA
#> 2 unnamed_t… a + b … <dbl>  succe… NA        0 NA    NA             0    NA
#> # ℹ 3 more variables: algorithm <chr>, controller <chr>, worker <chr>
```

The controller group has a `summary()` method which aggregates the summaries of one or more controllers.

```r
group$summary()
#> # A tibble: 2 × 8
#>   controller      tasks seconds success error crash cancel warning
#>   <chr>           <int>   <dbl>   <int> <int> <int>  <int>   <int>
#> 1 persistent          2       0       2     0     0      0       0
#> 2 semi-persistent     1       0       1     0     0      0       0
```

When you are finished, please call `terminate()` with no arguments to terminate all controllers in the controller group.

```r
group$terminate()
```

# Backup controllers

As described in the [introduction vignette](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/introduction.html#crashes-and-retries), a worker may crash if it runs out of memory or encounters a system-level issue. The controller lets you retry the task, but `pop()` throws an error if the task's worker crashed more than `crashes_max` times in a row.

Controller groups and backup controllers let you configure exactly how tasks are retried.
Each controller can designate a backup controller to run tasks that cause too many crashes in the original controller.
With backups, you can connect a whole chain of controllers with increasing resources.
If you put all these controllers in a controller group, then you can use group-level
`push()` and `pop()` methods without having to know which controller actually ran the task.

Consider the following example. We define three different controllers that use one another as backups. The `default` controller uses the `medium_memory` controller as a backup, and the `medium_memory` controller uses the `high_memory` controller as a backup.

```r
library(crew)
library(crew.cluster) # https://wlandau.github.io/crew.cluster/index.html

high_memory <- crew_controller_slurm(
  name = "high_memory",
  options_cluster = crew_options_slurm(memory_gigabytes_required = 64),
  crashes_max = 2
)

medium_memory <- crew_controller_slurm(
  name = "medium_memory",
  options_cluster = crew_options_slurm(memory_gigabytes_required = 64),
  crashes_max = 3,
  backup = high_memory
)

default <- crew_controller_slurm(
  name = "default",
  crashes_max = 4,
  backup = medium_memory
)
```

We put all three controllers in a controller group.
The `default` controller is listed first, so tasks pushed with `group$push()` will automatically run in the `default` unless special circumstances dictate otherwise.

```r
group <- crew_controller_group(default, medium_memory, high_memory)
```

Consider a task that sometimes exhausts the available memory of its [SLURM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager) worker:

```r
group$push(command = my.package::run_heavy_task(), name = "heavy_task")
```

If the task exhausts available memory and crashes its worker, then `pop()` informs you:

```r
task <- group$pop()
task[, c("name", "result", "status", "error", "code", "controller")]
#> # A tibble: 1 × 6
#>   name       result    status error                  code controller   
#>   <chr>      <list>    <chr>  <chr>                 <int> <chr>        
#> 1 heavy_task <lgl [1]> crash  19 | Connection reset    19 default
```

when you resubmit the task with `group$push()`, it will run on the default controller again. But if you keep resubmitting it and it crashes 4 times in a row (from `crashes_max = 4`) then the next `push()` will send it to the backup `medium_memory` controller. If the task's worker crashes in the next 3 pushes crash the task in the `medium_memory` controller, then subsequent pushes will use the `high_memory` controller, which is the backup of `medium_memory`. If the `high_memory` controller successfully completes the task, the next `group$pop()` returns a successful result. 

```r
task <- group$pop()
task[, c("name", "result", "status", "error", "code", "controller")]
# A tibble: 1 × 6
  name       result    status  error  code controller   
  <chr>      <list>    <chr>   <chr> <int> <chr>        
1 heavy_task <lgl [1]> success NA        0 high_memory
```

`group$summary()` counts the number of times each controller attempted the task, with crashes counted as errors.

```r
group$summary()
#> # A tibble: 2 × 8
#>   controller    tasks seconds success error crash cancel warning
#>   <chr>         <int>   <dbl>   <int> <int> <int>  <int>   <int>
#> 1 default       4       0       4     0     0      0       0
#> 2 medium_memory 3       0       3     0     0      0       0
#> 3 high_memory   1       0       1     0     0      0       0
```

If you use a controller group like this one in a [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline (with `tar_option_set(controller = "group")` in `_targets.R`) then `tar_make()` will automatically retry crashed tasks using the configuration in the controller group. This behavior requires [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) version 1.10.0.9002 or later.
