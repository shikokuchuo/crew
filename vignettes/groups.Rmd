Each controller object only supports only one type of worker configuration which you set in advance. However, different controllers may have different types of workers, and `crew` supports controller groups to coordinate among these different worker types. With third-party launcher subclasses from other packages, this mechanism will allow you to e.g. send some tasks to GPU-capable or high-memory workers while other tasks go to low-spec workers.

We demonstrate with a controller of fully persistent workers which always stay running and a controller of semi-persistent workers which terminate after completing four tasks. We create controller objects with names.

```r
library(crew)
persistent <- crew_controller_local(name = "persistent")
transient <- crew_controller_local(name = "semi-persistent", tasks_max = 4L)
```

`crew` uses a different TCP port for each controller you run, so please do not create hundreds of controllers. Please see the subsection on ports in the [README](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/index.html).

We put these controller objects into a new controller group object.

```r
group <- crew_controller_group(persistent, transient)
```

This controller group has a global `connect()` method to initialize both controllers.

```r
group$start()
```

You can choose which worker pool to receive tasks.

```r
group$push(name = "my task", command = sqrt(4), controller = "semi-persistent")
```

The controller group also supports global methods for `wait()`, `pop()`, and `terminate()`. These methods operate on all controllers at once by default, but the `controllers` argument allows you to select a subset of controllers to act on. Below in `pop()` the `launcher` column of the output indicates which controller ran the task.

```r
group$wait(controllers = "semi-persistent")
group$pop()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 13
#>   name    command result    status error  code trace warnings seconds  seed
#>   <chr>   <chr>   <list>    <chr>  <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>      <dbl> <int>
#> 1 my task sqrt(4) <dbl [1]> succe… NA        0 NA    NA             0    NA
#> # ℹ 3 more variables: algorithm <chr>, launcher <chr>, worker <chr>
```

The [`map()`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/reference/crew_class_controller.html#method-crew_class_controller-group-map) method provides functional programming, and the `controller` argument lets you choose the controller to submit the tasks.

```r
group$map(
  command = a + b + c + d,
  iterate = list(
    a = c(1, 3),
    b = c(2, 4)
  ),
  data = list(c = 5),
  globals = list(d = 6),
  controller = "persistent"
)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 13
#>   name       command result status error  code trace warnings seconds  seed
#>   <chr>      <chr>   <list> <chr>  <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>      <dbl> <int>
#> 1 unnamed_t… a + b … <dbl>  succe… NA        0 NA    NA             0    NA
#> 2 unnamed_t… a + b … <dbl>  succe… NA        0 NA    NA             0    NA
#> # ℹ 3 more variables: algorithm <chr>, launcher <chr>, worker <chr>
```

The controller group has a `summary()` method which aggregates the summaries of one or more controllers.

```r
group$summary()
#> # A tibble: 2 × 5
#>   controller      tasks seconds errors warnings
#>   <chr>           <int>   <dbl>  <int>    <int>
#> 1 persistent          2       0      0        0
#> 2 semi-persistent     1       0      0        0
```

When you are finished, please call `terminate()` with no arguments to terminate all controllers in the controller group.

```r
group$terminate()
```
